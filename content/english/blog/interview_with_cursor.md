## How do you interview an IDE?

This post is about having essentially an exit interview with Claude (running in Cursor IDE). 

Before getting into what Claude thought about our whole interaction and the project 'we' were working on, let me set the context a little bit.

## What was I trying to do?

I started a [Portfolio Management using MCP project](/blog/portfolio_management_with_mcp/) and decided that some parts of the API (like CRUD) should be something I can delegate to Cursor to build for me. 

Thought it would be a quick job.. boy was I wrong.

## The experience

**Don't let the clickbait image fool you, it wasn't a pleasant experience!**
