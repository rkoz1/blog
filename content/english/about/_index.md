First and foremost I'm a technologist and a tinkerer. Just writing syntax is not good enough for me, which is why I take the time to try and understand what is happening under the hood and what was the design methodology behind each tech that I use. I do PoC work on a lot of technologies also to be able to have an opinion, which I believe is the key to be a successful technical leader, especially in the architecture space.

 I've worked in software engineering within Finance for 14 years and have experience with plethora of languages and tools. I do have some favourites (especially when scripting or PoCing concept), however I try to keep an open mind, especially given how quickly things change in IT. At the same time, I do believe in keeping things simple - just because something is newer or FOTM doesn't mean it will solve the problem any better (see mantras below). 
 
 Engineering & Software Architecture has always been intriguing to me and especially now in the new age of AI, where with a single prompt you can rewrite a whole codebase, there will be a lot of paradigms shifting in terms of best practice and general approach to development. I think that's one of the reasons why its good to put some thoughts down (in the blog) not only about my experience with technologies and tools that I have recently used, but also capture what I think their impact will be on how we approach development & solution design.

####  Personal Software Engineering mantras

Pretty much anything in [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) as its powerful stuff and stands the test of time. Two favourites (that go hand in hand):
* *Simple is better than complex*
* *Complex is better than complicated*

**Design First** - draw it out before starting work

**'What are you trying to do?'** - words my technical mentor Wayne used to ask me when I demanded answers to questions I shouldn't be even asking...
